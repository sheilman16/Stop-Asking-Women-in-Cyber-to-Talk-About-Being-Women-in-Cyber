# Abstract
It’s already frustrating to live with all of the misogynistic problems related to being a woman in a male-dominated field, let alone be expected to continually re-describe and re-live them for the sake of your education. I am giving this talk to answer all your questions, so that you don’t have to keep asking women for the answer.
